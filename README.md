# RIWA ( Re Invent the Wheel Again ) 

RIWA is an attempt to re-ivent all the ML and DL algorithms as if, no other package is available in the industry right now; my goal is to test my knowledge of the under-the-hood workings of all AI algorithms, which will make me eventually better at AI. If you're looking at this repository, at this initial stage, the code you'll find is still messy and not structured using OOP concepts, the goal was to first get a working version and then polish later. Please bare with it for a short while.
